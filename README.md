***UNDER DEVELOPMENT***

hsi_atk is a hyperspectral image (hsi) analysis toolkit that features simple simulated hsi generators and analysis pipelines. The features include:

1. hsi generators
2. arbitrary labeling for images
3. dataset storage techniques using h5py
4. analysis pipelines for composed learning and estimation

The hsi_atk utilizes scikit-learn, scikit-hyper, scikit-image, numpy, scipy, h5py, and custom functions and classes.
